To dream is to imagine a world not confined by the present
but enlightened by the possibility of the future.

To create, then, is to bring substance tothe ethereal,
form to the formless. It is the courage to step
beyond the known, to dance on the edge of uncertainty,
and to risk failing in the pursuit of something
truly original, something truly meaningful.

After all, the future isn't just  
something we wait for.
